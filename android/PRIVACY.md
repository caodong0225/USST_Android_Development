# Privacy Policy

## What data the Gotify app might collect, store and process

The app only records data strictly necessary for the app to function. This
includes for example the app settings and images caches. The app does not
include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code,
such as Google Analytics.

gotify/android needs to be connected to a gotify/server for full functionality
and the app may share data with this server. After the app is launched, you
will be prompted to set a gotify/server URL. You, as a user, are responsible
for verifying that you can trust this server instance.

For best privacy, you should host gotify/server yourself, as then only you have
access to your data.

## What app data other parties might collect, store and process

If you have activated "backup & reset" in your phone settings (Settings /
Backup & Reset / Back up my data), you should be aware that Android itself will
periodically save a copy of your phone’s data in Google’s servers. For more
information, see [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com).

## What data the Gotify team may have access to

The developers of Gotify do **not** have access to any of your information,
except when you

- actively share debugging information (either via email using the 'Crash
  Report' function, or via the Android crash reporting functionality of
  Google):
  - device type
  - Android version
  - Gotify version
  - Error messages
- actively share a review in the Google Play store:
  - public profile information
  - Gotify version
  - device type
  - device language
  - Android version

## Updates of this Privacy Policy

The developers may update this policy in the future. It is advisable to check
the policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are
effective when they are made on this document.
